# COGS 18 Project
This project was created for people have roommates, and they would like to know when they can have some alone time. The idea stems from when2meet, but, rather than trying to find a time when people can meet, it finds when one person is free and the other person is busy. The project is run as a script, and it takes in a file argument. The file should be formatted where each line contains a time that a person is busy. There will be one line that has a '#' to represent the separation between the first person's schedule and the second person's schedule. You can see an example of how formatting should work in test-schedules-1.txt and test-schedules-2.txt. To find free times for a person, that person's schedule should be inputted first in the file. Another thing to note is that this script currently only works for people with one roommmate. Finally, the script only seems to work when run in the MyProjectFolder directory.
